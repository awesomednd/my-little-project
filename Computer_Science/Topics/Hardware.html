        <h1>Hardware</h1>
        <p>Hardware is the components in a computer.</p>
        <h2>CPU (Central Processing Unit)</h2>
        <p>The CPU is the brain of the computer it runs every instruction of the computer.</p>
        <p>The CPU is used in all kinds of things. E.G.</p>
        <p>TV - uses it to decode the video and to run the OSD (On Screen Display). <br> Washing machine - to control the heat and to keep the machine in time.</p>
        <p>This uses the <strong>Microprocceser</strong> which unlike old computers where the CPU could be the size of a room a microprocceser can be the size of a few centimeter.</p>
        <h2>The fetch-decode-execute cycle</h2>
        <h3>Structure of the cpu</h3>
        <p>This is a diagram of the CPU. AB = Adress Bus. DB = Data bus. CU = Control Unit. MAR = memmory adress register. MDR = Memmory Data Registor</p>
        <h3>The fetch stage</h3>
        <p>In the fetch stage The CPU will fetch the instruction from the cache of the cpu which has the same program counter and it would first check the inturupte and run that first.</p>
        <h3>The Decode Satge</h3>
        <p>In the decode stage the CU will decode the instruction using an instruction set. This contains the full commands for teh CPU so the CPU can procces the instructions</p>
        <h3>The Execute Stage</h3>
        <p>In this stage the instruction are read and run by the CU and the answer is now sent to the ram</p>
        <h2>Factors That Can Affect The Preformance Of A CPU</h2>
        <p>CPU's can be affect by many things such as the clock speed (The clock speed is the speed at which commands are executed.) Other things that can effect the CPU speed is the amount of cores (Cores are a phsical proccers on the chip and it can have multiple and it can then run multiple diffrent commands at once.) and the cache (the cache is the storage on the CPU that holds the commands the the CPU is currently working on.).</p>
        <h2>Input and Output Devices</h2>
        <p>Input and output devices are used to input data and output data.</p>
        <h3>Input devices</h3>
        <p>There are many diffrent types of input devices here are some examples. E.G.</p>
        <p>Barcode scanner <br> Digital camera <br> Keyboard <br> Microphone <br> Optical mouse <br> QR code scanner <br> Scanner (2D and 3D) <br> Touch screen (resistive, capacitive and infra-red)</p>
        <h3>Output devices</h3>
        <p>There are many diffrent types of output devices here are some examples. E.G.</p>
        <p>Actuator <br> Digital Light Processing (DLP) projector <br> Inkjet printer <br> Laser printer <br> Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) screen <br> Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) projector <br> Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) screen <br> speaker <br> 3D printer</p>
        <h2>Sensor</h2>
        <p>Their are many types of sensor here are some examples. E.G.</p>

                <td>Acoustic</td>
                <td>This type of sensors measures the level of sound in an enviroment.</td>
                <td>These sensors are used in many applications that involve sound. An acoustic sensor can be used in a security system. It can be placed near a window and constantly measure the level of sound. If it captures a reading that shows a sudden increase in sound, this could mean that the window has been broken and the building may be at risk.</td>

            <tr>
                <td>Accelerometer</td>
                <td>This type of sensor measures acceleration forces. These may be static forces, such as the continual force of gravity. They can also be dynamic forces, such as those created by movement and vibrations.</td>
                <td>These sensors are used in a wide variety of devices. Mobile phones use an accelerometer to know which way up it is faced, to automatically turn the screen on and off. They can be used to monitor for earthquakes, as they can capture the inital vibrations are created. They can also be used in cars to sense when a crash has occurred, so that airbags can be inflated.</td>

                <td>Flow</td>
                <td>This type of sensor measures the amount of liquid, gas or steam that is flowing through or around a certant enviroment.</td>
                <td>These sensors are offten used in factories and sites such as nuclear power plants. they make sure that the liquid gas or steam is flowing at a consistant Flowrate through an enviroment, such as a pipe. This makes sure that the pipes don't rupture and break due to too much flowing through them.</td>

                <td>Gas</td>
                <td>This type of sensor measures the presence and concentration of a gas within the immediate atmosphere.</td>
                <td>These sensors can be used in people's homes. They can be set to measure a certant gas such as carbon monoxide. They constantly capture the data in the immediate atmosphere to see if too much COâ‚‚ is present, which could endanger the health of anyone living in the home.</td>
