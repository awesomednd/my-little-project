        <h1>Hardware</h1>
        <p>Hardware is the components in a computer.</p>
        <h2>CPU (Central Processing Unit)</h2>
        <p>The CPU is the brain of the computer it runs every instruction of the computer.</p>
        <p>The CPU is used in all kinds of things. E.G.</p>
        <p>TV - uses it to decode the video and to run the OSD (On Screen Display). <br> Washing machine - to control the heat and to keep the machine in time.</p>
        <p>This uses the <strong>Microprocceser</strong> which unlike old computers where the CPU could be the size of a room a microprocceser can be the size of a few centimeter.</p>
        <h2>The fetch-decode-execute cycle</h2>
        <h3>Structure of the cpu</h3>
        <p>This is a diagram of the CPU. AB = Adress Bus. DB = Data bus. CU = Control Unit. MAR = memmory adress register. MDR = Memmory Data Registor</p>
        <h3>The fetch stage</h3>
        <p>In the fetch stage The CPU will fetch the instruction from the cache of the cpu which has the same program counter and it would first check the inturupte and run that first.</p>
