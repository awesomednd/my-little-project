        <h1>Hardware</h1>
        <p>Hardware is the components in a computer.</p>
        <h2>CPU (Central Processing Unit)</h2>
        <p>The CPU is the brain of the computer it runs every instruction of the computer.</p>
        <p>The CPU is used in all kinds of things. E.G.</p>
        <p>TV - uses it to decode the video and to run the OSD (On Screen Display). <br> Washing machine - to control the heat and to keep the machine in time.</p>
        <p>This uses the <strong>Microprocceser</strong> which unlike old computers where the CPU could be the size of a room a microprocceser can be the size of a few centimeter.</p>
        <h2>The fetch-decode-execute cycle</h2>
        <h3>Structure of the cpu</h3>
        <p>This is a diagram of the CPU. AB = Adress Bus. DB = Data bus. CU = Control Unit. MAR = memmory adress register. MDR = Memmory Data Registor</p>
        <h3>The fetch stage</h3>
        <p>In the fetch stage The CPU will fetch the instruction from the cache of the cpu which has the same program counter and it would first check the inturupte and run that first.</p>
        <h3>The Decode Satge</h3>
        <p>In the decode stage the CU will decode the instruction using an instruction set. This contains the full commands for teh CPU so the CPU can procces the instructions</p>
        <h3>The Execute Stage</h3>
        <p>In this stage the instruction are read and run by the CU and the answer is now sent to the ram</p>
        <h2>Factors That Can Affect The Preformance Of A CPU</h2>
        <p>CPU's can be affect by many things such as the clock speed (The clock speed is the speed at which commands are executed.) Other things that can effect the CPU speed is the amount of cores (Cores are a phsical proccers on the chip and it can have multiple and it can then run multiple diffrent commands at once.) and the cache (the cache is the storage on the CPU that holds the commands the the CPU is currently working on.).</p>
        <h2>Input and Output Devices</h2>
        <p>Input and output devices are used to input data and output data.</p>
        <h3>Input devices</h3>
        <p>There are many diffrent types of input devices here are some examples. E.G.</p>
        <p>Barcode scanner <br> Digital camera <br> Keyboard <br> Microphone <br> Optical mouse <br> QR code scanner <br> Scanner (2D and 3D) <br> Touch screen (resistive, capacitive and infra-red)</p>
        <h3>Output devices</h3>
        <p>There are many diffrent types of output devices here are some examples. E.G.</p>
        <p>Actuator <br> Digital Light Processing (DLP) projector <br> Inkjet printer <br> Laser printer <br> Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) screen <br> Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) projector <br> Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) screen <br> speaker <br> 3D printer</p>
        <h2>Sensor</h2>
        <p>Their are many types of sensor here are some examples. E.G.</p>

It can be placed near a window and constantly measure the level of sound.

                <td>These sensors are used in a wide variety of devices. Mobile phones use an accelerometer to know which way up it is faced, to automatically turn the screen on and off. They can be used to monitor for earthquakes, as they can capture the inital vibrations are created. They can also be used in cars to sense when a crash has occurred, so that airbags can be inflated.</td>

It can also operate by capturing the infra-red radiation emitted by the intruder.</td>

When the window or door is opened, the pressure will decrease, and the syetem will recognise that an intruderd has enterd.

        <h2>Data storage</h2>
        <p>ROM (Read Only Memory) can also be refured to as an ssd which is tecnicaly RAM (Random Access memory) Which is not volatile</p>
        <p>We need to store data on a computer somehow the two types of storage. Primary storage, primart storage is the storage that the cpu accesses directly without any controler, this is normaly RAM (Random Access Memory). Seccondary storage, seccondary storage is the storage that all the files you save go to and the operating system is stored on this uses ROM (Read Only Memory). <br> here are the characteristics. E.G.</p>
