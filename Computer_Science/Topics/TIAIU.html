        <h1>The internet and its uses</h1>
        <p>This section is about the The internet and its uses.</p>
        <h2>The internet and the world wide web</h2>
        <p>The internet and the world wide web; aren't they the same thing? Although the terms are used interchangeably, they aren,t the same thing. Bonus points if you knew that already! The <strong class="Colour">internet</strong> is an <strong class="Colour">infrastructure</strong>. This means it is all the components and cables that are used to connect one device to another. Another way that the internet can be describe is that it is one huge <strong class="Colour">network</strong>. More specifically, it is a type of network calld a wide area network (WAN). This is a type of network that spans a large geographic area, in this case the whole world! The internet is an incredible structure if you think that homes and businesses all over the world are able to use it to connect to each other. Millions and millions of people use this huge infrastructure.</p>
        <p>The <strong class="Colour">world wide web</strong> is the collective term for all the <strong class="Colour">websites</strong> and <strong class="Colour">web pages</strong> that are available. The world wide web is accessed by using the internet</p>
        <h2>Requesting and retrieving web pages</h2>
        <p>A <strong class="Colour">URL</strong> is  a fundamental component of the world wide web. Each website and webpage on the world wide web has a text based address. This address is called a URL. To access the webpage, a user types the URL into the address bar of a <strong class="Colour">web browser</strong>. <br> A URL has three main components: the <strong class="Colour">protocol</strong>, the <strong class="Colour">domain name</strong> and the web page or file name.</p>
        <h3>The hole procces of getting to the website</h3>
        <p>https://www.montessoriafrica.co.za/gen-z-lab</p>
        <p>Here is a URL the first part "https://" is the protocol. Next the "www." can be ignored as web browsers dont requiear it any more. "montessoriafrica.co.za" is the domain name and "gen-z-lab" is the web page address.</p>
        <p>There is a whole procces involved in requesting and retrieving web pages that you need to understand, the URL and its three components are fundamental to this process. So how is a web page requested and retrieved by our computers?</p>
        <p>To start the procces, the user opens their web browser and types the URL into the address bar. The web browser then sends the URL for the website to the <strong class="Colour">domain name server (DNS)</strong>. The DNS is a special kind of server that stores all the diffrent domain names (part of the url which is shown previously) along with their equivalent IP address. The DNS looks through its databaseof domain names to find the equivalent IP address. As you can imagine, there are billions of websites, so these are not all stored on a single DNS. Therefore, the first DNS will search its database and if it dosen't find the domain name, it sends it to the next DNS. This will happen until the domain name is found, or if it is not found, a message is sent back to the web browser to say that the website is not found. When the DNS finds the domain name, it sends the equivalent IP address back to the web browser - the IP address of the <strong class="Colour">web browser</strong> that stores the website.</p>
        <p>The web browser receives the IP address for the website from the DNS. It now knows where to find the website. The web browser sends a request to the web server to ask for the web page from the website. It uses a protocol called the <strong class="Colour">hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP)</strong> to send the request to the web server. Each web page is created using <strong class="Colour">hypertext markup language (HTML)</strong>, these study notes is written  in HTML and CSS, <strong class="Colour">cascading style sheets (CSS)</strong> and may incluid <strong class="Colour">active script</strong> such as JavaScript. When the web server receives a request for a web page, it sends the data for website, including  the HTML, CSS and any active script, back to the web browser using HTTP. The web browser then renders the HTML and CSS and runs any active script to display the web page.</p>
        <p>Another protocol can be used to request the data for the web pages that will require an additional process to take place. This protocol is the <strong class="Colour">hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS)</strong>. This protocol has an additional layer of security that <strong class="Colour">encrypts</strong> any data that is transferred. It involves the use of <strong class="Colour">digital certificates</strong>. This is a certificate that the owners of the website need to apply for from a <strong class="Colour">certificate authority</strong>. A certificate authority is an organisation that checks whether a website is authentic and trustworthy. If the certificate authority believe the website us authentic, they will issue them with a digital certificate. This is how the additional layer of security is created. <br> Before the web browser sends the request to the web server to ask for the web pages, it sends a request to the web server asking it to povide a digital certificate. <br> The we server sends a copy of the digital certificate to the web server. <br> The web browser checks if the digital certificate is authentic. <br> If the certificate is authentic, the web browser will allow communication to continue with the web server and any data that is transmitted between the two is encrypted. <br> If the certificate is not authentic, the web browser will report that the website is not secure.</p>
        <p>The HTTPS protocol is the standard HTTP protocol with a layer security combined, that is either the <strong class="Colour">secure sockets layer (SSL)</strong> or <strong class="Colour">transport layer security (TLS) protocol</strong>. TLS is a newer version of SSL. This is the protocol that is used to create the encryption. You can check visually whether a website is secure by seeing if it uses the HTTPS protocol. If it dose, you will see this at the start of the URL in the address bar in the web browser. You will also see a small padlock before the start of the URL. Most web browsers also have an option for you to view the digital certificate for the website. This is often found by right clicking your mouse on the padlock.</p>
        <h2>The purpose of a web browser</h2>
        <p>You may have noticed that the web browser has a key role in the requesting and retrieving of web pages. The main purpose of a web browser is that it is a software application that allows you to access information that is available on the world wide web. As you learnt previously, it dose this by requesting the HTML files and other data required to create the web page, then <strong class="Colour">renders</strong> this data so that you can view the web page.</p>
        <p>One thing to note about a web browser is that some people confuse it with a search engine. This is because some web browser software development companies also produce search engines too. One example of this is Google. Google produce a search a search engine called google, that you can use to find information on the world wide web, however this is not a browser. The browser that Google produce is Google Chrome. This is the software that allows you to open web pages, such as the google search engine.</p>
        <p>Did you know that there are lots of other things that a web browser can do? <br> This is a list of some of the main functions of a web browser, how many have you used before?</p>
        <p>It provides an <strong class="Colour">address bar</strong> that you can use to type in a URL.</p>
        <p>It keeps a record of all the web pages that you have visited. <br> This is called <strong class="Colour">user history</strong>.</p>
        <p>It allows you to <strong class="Colour">bookmark</strong> web pages and set web pages as your favourites. <br> These can then be displayed on the toolbar of your web browser to allow you to access them much more quickly. It means you can just click the bookmark or favourite icon and it will take you straight to the web page.</p>
        <p>It allows you to open multiple <strong class="Colour">tabs</strong> at a time. The browser itself opens into a <strong class="Colour">window</strong> on your computer. Without tabs, you would need to open multiple windows if you wanted to open more than one web page at a time. Tabs allow you to open multiple web pages in the same browser window which makes it easier to navigate between the diffrent web pages that you have open.</p>
        <p>It allows you to navigate between web pages. The buttons that are most commonly available on a web browser are forward, back and reload the page.</p>
        <p>It stores <strong class="Colour">cookies</strong> and manages the process of transmitting them.</p>
        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>Cookies sadly, the tasty kind, but a useful function of a web browser. So, what exactly is a cookie? A very simple explanation is that it is a small text file that is used to store data, normally about you.</p>
        <p>They are very useful as they can store data that you may regularly use on the internet. This means that you do not need to enter this data every time. Examples of this are:</p>
        <p>Storing your username and password for accounts such as your social media.</p>
        <p>Storing your bank card details for buying products and services online.</p>
        <p>Storing products in a virtual shopping cart when you are buying multiple products from an online company. It can also save the items in your cart so that you can buy them at a later date if you don't want to buy them now.</p>
        <p>Cookies can be used to tailor your online experience with websites. Some websites allow you to format the website int the way that you want it to look, for example, changing the colour of text and boxes that appear on the web page. Cookies can also be used to track the diffent content that you look at on the world wide web. For example, if you look at web pages about your favourite hobby or interest, you will find that advertisements appear on web pages that are about your favourite hobby too. This is called targeted advertising.</p>
