        <h1>The internet and its uses</h1>
        <p>This section is about the The internet and its uses.</p>
        <h2>The internet and the world wide web</h2>
        <p>The internet and the world wide web; aren't they the same thing? Although the terms are used interchangeably, they aren,t the same thing. Bonus points if you knew that already! The <strong class="Colour">internet</strong> is an <strong class="Colour">infrastructure</strong>. This means it is all the components and cables that are used to connect one device to another. Another way that the internet can be describe is that it is one huge <strong class="Colour">network</strong>. More specifically, it is a type of network calld a wide area network (WAN). This is a type of network that spans a large geographic area, in this case the whole world! The internet is an incredible structure if you think that homes and businesses all over the world are able to use it to connect to each other. Millions and millions of people use this huge infrastructure.</p>
        <p>The <strong class="Colour">world wide web</strong> is the collective term for all the <strong class="Colour">websites</strong> and <strong class="Colour">web pages</strong> that are available. The world wide web is accessed by using the internet</p>
        <h2>Requesting and retrieving web pages</h2>
        <p>A <strong class="Colour">URL</strong> is  a fundamental component of the world wide web. Each website and webpage on the world wide web has a text based address. This address is called a URL. To access the webpage, a user types the URL into the address bar of a <strong class="Colour">web browser</strong>. <br> A URL has three main components: the <strong class="Colour">protocol</strong>, the <strong class="Colour">domain name</strong> and the web page or file name.</p>
        <h3>The hole procces of getting to the website</h3>
        <p>https://www.montessoriafrica.co.za/gen-z-lab</p>
        <p>Here is a URL the first part "https://" is the protocol. Next the "www." can be ignored as web browsers dont requiear it any more. "montessoriafrica.co.za" is the domain name and "gen-z-lab" is the web page address.</p>
        <p>There is a whole procces involved in requesting and retrieving web pages that you need to understand, the URL and its three components are fundamental to this process. So how is a web page requested and retrieved by our computers?</p>
        <p>To start the procces, the user opens their web browser and types the URL into the address bar. The web browser then sends the URL for the website to the <strong class="Colour">domain name server (DNS)</strong>. The DNS is a special kind of server that stores all the diffrent domain names (part of the url which is shown previously) along with their equivalent IP address. The DNS looks through its databaseof domain names to find the equivalent IP address. As you can imagine, there are billions of websites, so these are not all stored on a single DNS. Therefore, the first DNS will search its database and if it dosen't find the domain name, it sends it to the next DNS. This will happen until the domain name is found, or if it is not found, a message is sent back to the web browser to say that the website is not found. When the DNS finds the domain name, it sends the equivalent IP address back to the web browser - the IP address of the <strong class="Colour">web browser</strong> that stores the website.</p>
        <p>The web browser receives the IP address for the website from the DNS. It now knows where to find the website. The web browser sends a request to the web server to ask for the web page from the website. It uses a protocol called the <strong class="Colour">hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP)</strong> to send the request to the web server. Each web page is created using <strong class="Colour">hypertext markup language (HTML)</strong>, these study notes is written  in HTML and CSS, <strong class="Colour">cascading style sheets (CSS)</strong> and may incluid <strong class="Colour">active script</strong> such as JavaScript. When the web server receives a request for a web page, it sends the data for website, including  the HTML, CSS and any active script, back to the web browser using HTTP. The web browser then renders the HTML and CSS and runs any active script to display the web page.</p>
        <p>Another protocol can be used to request the data for the web pages that will require an additional process to take place. This protocol is the <strong class="Colour">hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS)</strong>. This protocol has an additional layer of security that <strong class="Colour">encrypts</strong> any data that is transferred. It involves the use of <strong class="Colour">digital certificates</strong>. This is a certificate that the owners of the website need to apply for from a <strong class="Colour">certificate authority</strong>. A certificate authority is an organisation that checks whether a website is authentic and trustworthy. If the certificate authority believe the website us authentic, they will issue them with a digital certificate. This is how the additional layer of security is created. <br> Before the web browser sends the request to the web server to ask for the web pages, it sends a request to the web server asking it to povide a digital certificate. <br> The we server sends a copy of the digital certificate to the web server. <br> The web browser checks if the digital certificate is authentic. <br> If the certificate is authentic, the web browser will allow communication to continue with the web server and any data that is transmitted between the two is encrypted. <br> If the certificate is not authentic, the web browser will report that the website is not secure.</p>
        <p>The HTTPS protocol is the standard HTTP protocol with a layer security combined, that is either the <strong class="Colour">secure sockets layer (SSL)</strong> or <strong class="Colour">transport layer security (TLS) protocol</strong>. TLS is a newer version of SSL. This is the protocol that is used to create the encryption. You can check visually whether a website is secure by seeing if it uses the HTTPS protocol. If it dose, you will see this at the start of the URL in the address bar in the web browser. You will also see a small padlock before the start of the URL. Most web browsers also have an option for you to view the digital certificate for the website. This is often found by right clicking your mouse on the padlock.</p>
        <h2>The purpose of a web browser</h2>
        <p>You may have noticed that the web browser has a key role in the requesting and retrieving of web pages. The main purpose of a web browser is that it is a software application that allows you to access information that is available on the world wide web. As you learnt previously, it dose this by requesting the HTML files and other data required to create the web page, then <strong class="Colour">renders</strong> this data so that you can view the web page.</p>
        <p>One thing to note about a web browser is that some people confuse it with a search engine. This is because some web browser software development companies also produce search engines too. One example of this is Google. Google produce a search a search engine called google, that you can use to find information on the world wide web, however this is not a browser. The browser that Google produce is Google Chrome. This is the software that allows you to open web pages, such as the google search engine.</p>
        <p>Did you know that there are lots of other things that a web browser can do? <br> This is a list of some of the main functions of a web browser, how many have you used before?</p>
        <p>It provides an <strong class="Colour">address bar</strong> that you can use to type in a URL.</p>
        <p>It keeps a record of all the web pages that you have visited. <br> This is called <strong class="Colour">user history</strong>.</p>
        <p>It allows you to <strong class="Colour">bookmark</strong> web pages and set web pages as your favourites. <br> These can then be displayed on the toolbar of your web browser to allow you to access them much more quickly. It means you can just click the bookmark or favourite icon and it will take you straight to the web page.</p>
        <p>It allows you to open multiple <strong class="Colour">tabs</strong> at a time. The browser itself opens into a <strong class="Colour">window</strong> on your computer. Without tabs, you would need to open multiple windows if you wanted to open more than one web page at a time. Tabs allow you to open multiple web pages in the same browser window which makes it easier to navigate between the diffrent web pages that you have open.</p>
        <p>It allows you to navigate between web pages. The buttons that are most commonly available on a web browser are forward, back and reload the page.</p>
        <p>It stores <strong class="Colour">cookies</strong> and manages the process of transmitting them.</p>
        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>Cookies sadly, the tasty kind, but a useful function of a web browser. So, what exactly is a cookie? A very simple explanation is that it is a small text file that is used to store data, normally about you.</p>
        <p>They are very useful as they can store data that you may regularly use on the internet. This means that you do not need to enter this data every time. Examples of this are:</p>
        <p>Storing your username and password for accounts such as your social media.</p>
        <p>Storing your bank card details for buying products and services online.</p>
        <p>Storing products in a virtual shopping cart when you are buying multiple products from an online company. It can also save the items in your cart so that you can buy them at a later date if you don't want to buy them now.</p>
        <p>Cookies can be used to tailor your online experience with websites. Some websites allow you to format the website int the way that you want it to look, for example, changing the colour of text and boxes that appear on the web page. Cookies can also be used to track the diffent content that you look at on the world wide web. For example, if you look at web pages about your favourite hobby or interest, you will find that advertisements appear on web pages that are about your favourite hobby too. This is called targeted advertising.</p>
        <p>Cookies are created when you visit a web page an then they are stored by your web browser. There are two main types of cookie <strong class="Colour">session cookies</strong> and <strong class="Colour">persistent cookies</strong>.</p>
        <p>Session cookies are temporary files that are created when you visit a web page. As soon as you close your web browser, these cookies are deleted. If you open your web browser again and go back to the same web page, the web page will not recognise you. That means that it will not be sent any cookies by your web browser, about your personal details or preferences, as this type of cookie are not saved by the browser once it is closed. You might experienced this type of cookie when you are online shopping. You may have added several items that you wanted to buy to a shopping cart on a website, you then close your browser. You then open your web browser at a later date and go back to the web page, only to find that the items you put in the online shopping cart are no longer there. This is because it is a session cookie that is used to temporarily store them.</p>
        <p>Persistentvcookies are permanent files that are created when you visit a web page. These are stored by your web browser onto the hard drive of your computer. When you visit the same web page again, the cookie file is sent back to the web server that stores the web page to provide the data about your personal details or preferences. This will allow your login details to be automatically entered, for example. These cookies will remain stored on your hard drive until you manually delete them, or your browser deletes them becasue they have expired. Each persistent cookie file is sent with an expiration date. When this expiration date is reached, the web browser will delete this cookie form your hard drive. </p>
        <p>Internet users have mixed feelings about cookies. This is because they can have a very useful role but can also be used for improper activities. Cookies do build up an online profile about your details and preferences. Some people also believe that this data can be gathered to build a profile about you and add to the risk of your identity being stolen. If you are worried about this being a possibility, you can limit the use of cookies in your online activity by changing the settings for your web browser.</p>
        <h2>Digital currency</h2>
        <p>When you pay for products and services using the internet, you will normally use <strong class="Colour">digital currency</strong>. A digital currency is one that exists electronicly. It is a method of payment that is similar to playing with coins and bank notes. However, rather than exchanging physical bank notes and coins to make the payment, the currency is exchanged digitally using computers. There are several diffrent forms of digital currency, the most popular are payments using credit cards, mobile phones and smart watches. The most common of these is using credit cards when making payments using the internet.</p>
        <p>When the data about the payment with the digital currency is sent from one computer to another, it is encrypted to keep it secure. The method of encryption used is what was disccused in a earler, using HTTPS protocol (This is only used to give the card number to the other bank which then uses a diffrent encryption method for the actual transfer.). The payment details for the use of a digital currency can be stored in a persistent cookie. Rhat means that each time you visit the website to buy a product, your payment details will be automatically entered so you don't need to type them in each time.</p>
        <p>One type of digital currency that you may of heard of is Bitcoin. This type of digital currency is more specifically known as a <strong class="Colour">cryptocurrency</strong>. The banks that we use to manage our money on a daily basis are called centralised systems. This means that there is an authority at the center managing th process in which they are used. In tis case, the bank is the authority. A cryptocurrency is a decentralised system, this means that there is no central authority, like a bank, managing the process of payments. Payments are also encrypted using this type of currency. As there is no central authority managing the system of payments with this type of digital currency, a diffent system called <strong class="Colour">blockchain</strong> is used to keep track of the payments.</p>
        <p>In its most basic form, blockchain is a list of all the records made with the digital currency. This is called a <strong class="Colour">digital ledger</strong>. Each time a payment is made with the digital currency, a reccord is added to the ledger that includes a digital signature with the time and date the payment is made. In blockchaining, once these records are added to the digital ledger, they cannot be changed. Data that is stored in a digital ledger. This prevents anyone being able to change the data. However, anyone who wants to view the data in the digital ledger is able to do so.</p>
        <h2>Cyber security</h2>
        <p>Whilst the internet and the world wide web can be a fun and interesting place, it dose also have some issues and threats that you definitely need to be aware of. You need to know how these cyber threats are created, what the motivation is behind those who use them, and what kind of security solution you can put in plae to try and prevent them from happening. One thing to note is that each security solution may not prevent them from happening. One thing to note is that each security solution may not be a complete prevention, something it is better to have several solutions in place. Also, <strong class="Colour">perptrators</strong> are always looking to develop ways to beat security solutions, so no solution will be 100% effective in preventing an attack. However, if you don't have any security solutions in place, you are putting your personal data at a far greater risk of these cyber threats. So, what are the cyber threats that you need to know?</p>
        <h3>Brute-force attack</h3>
        <p>You may have heard someone being described as a brute person. This is normally means people think they are strong and forceful. This is exactly what a <strong class="Colour">Brute-force attack</strong> is on your computer, a strong and forceful attack. Imagine that someone is banging on a locked door, pushing and shoving it in every way that they can, until the door gives way and opens. In a brute force attack, a perpetrator tries to break into your computer or account. They do this by repeatedly entering diffrent password combinations until they manage to enter the correct one. They may try to do this manually, by typing in each password combination themselves. They could also do this by developing a software program that will automatically cycle through many diffrent combinations until the correct one is found.</p>
        <p>The perpetrator usually dose this to gain access to your computer or account in the hope that they can either steal some personal data that they can use for criminal activity, or they may try to use your account to purchase items online as though it was their own account.</p>
        <p>There are several cyber security solutions that you can put in place to help prevent a Brute-force attack on your computer or account. The first is to make sure that you have a strong password to protect your data. A strong password is created by mixing diffren uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. Ideally mixing these in a way that dose not form any kind of word or phrase. A long string of a mixture of all these characters is the best protection thay you can give your data. This will make it much more difficult for any perpetrator or software program to guess your password. It can be easy to find out simple information about you, for example, that you have a rabit called MR Snuffles. Therefore, if your password is mrsnuffles01, this is not going to be difficult for a perpetrator to guess. Make life a bit more difficult for them, your data is precious! An example of a strong password is: <br> <strong class="Mid">1gH6dk@dn1wm!dosTsj1pa</strong></p>
        <p>Many web browsers now have a function that will suggest a strong password for you, mixing a combination of characters like this. They will also save the password for you, so you don't need to keep remembering the string of characters.</p>
        <p>Another security solution that can be used to help prevent a brute-force attack is limiting the number of times a password can be entered before the account is locked. You may have had this issue bofore. You type in what you think you had as the password for the account, but it is rejected, so you try another and that gets rejected, then you try a third one and that is rejected, and you now get a message saying that you are locked out of your account. How frustrating! However, be very thankful for this security soloution, however annoying it can be. It is likely that for a perpetrator to brute-force their way into your account, it will take more than three guesses at your password. Therefore, if the number of attempts is limited before the account is locked, this can prevent man guesses being made to try and find out the password.</p>
        <p>A third security soloution that can be used is a <strong class="Colour">biometric password</strong>. A <strong class="Colour">biometric password</strong> is one that needs your biological data to be input. An example is a fingerprint scanner, which requires your fingerprint to be input. Our biological data is unique to us, it is highly unlikely that you will find another person that has exactly the same fingerprint as you. Therefore, if you secure your computer or account with a biological password, such as your fingerprint, no ammount of guessing your password would allow a perpetrator to brute-force their way into your account. They would need to somehow obtain your fingerprint, which is a much more difficult task.</p>
        <p>A Fourth security solution that can be used is <strong class="Colour">two-step verification</strong> (Sometimes known as two-factor authentication). This is a method that puts two tasks in place in order to enter an account. The first task is entering the password, but then a seccond step is added that will require an additional input task to enter the account. The seccond piece of data is often a code or word that is sent to you that you will need to enter. This is normally sent to either your mobile phone number via SMS, your email address or a trusted device. This means that a perpetrator will not only need to guess the password for your account, but that they will also need to have access to your mobile phone, your email or a trusted device, this is an added difficulty. Some banks also have a small credit card reading device that provide you with data for the seccond step. You put your bank card into a reader, enter a PIN code or password and this generates the code for the seccond step for you to input. It is advisable that you look at the privacy and security settings for your online accounts, especially ones like your email and social media. Many companies have an option for you to turn on the feature of two-step verification which helps keep your personal data more secure.</p>
        <p>In summary:</p>

            <tr>

        <h3>Data interception</h3>
        <p>Billions of piecs of data are sent accross the large network that is the internet on a daily basis. A lot of this data is people sending their personal data to do things like buy products and services, and log into their online accounts. Perpetrators would very much like to get hold of their information so that they can use it in criminal activity, such as identity theft and fraud. A way that they will try and do this is by intercepting <strong class="Colour">data packets</strong> as they are transmitted accross the network from one device to another. This is often done by using a peice of software called a <strong class="Colour">packet sniffer</strong>, this is normally installed onto a peice of hardware that packets will pass through, for example, a router. This software is used to examine packets of data that are sent accross a network to see if they contain data that looks useful. If they do, the software will report the useful data packets it has found back to the perpetrator.</p>\
        <p>The main security soloution that you can use to keep data secure that is sent over a network is encryption. Data is normally encrypted the SSL protocol. This security solution will not stop the data packets from being intercepted, but it will mean that if the data packets are intercepted, the data contained in the packets will be meaningless to anyone who tries to read them. Remember you can check to see if a website is encrypts your data before transmission by looking to see if the URL uses HTTPS. it often possible, in your web browser settings, to set your web browser to only connect to websites that use encryption to trasmit data.</p>
        <p>Have you ever gone into a cafe or a store and thought, 'excellent, free WI-FI!' and you immediately connect to it? perpetrators can use this kind of insentive to get you to connect to the network through a system of theirs. Any data that you send using then connection can be intercepted by the perpetrator. It is advisable, if you see a free WI-FI connection, to ask the cafe or store if it is their free WI-FI before you connect to it.</p>
        <p>In summary:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>What happens?</th>
                <td>Data packets are intercepted and examined through the use of software such as a packet sniffer.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>What is the aim?</th>
                <td>To steal your precious personal data for criminal activity such as identity theft or fraud.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>What security solutions can be used?</th>
                <td>Encryption such as the SSL protocol and visually cheking the URL of a website to see if it uses the https protocol.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <h3>Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack</h3>
        <p>To carry out a <strong class="Colour">DDoS attack</strong>, a perpetrator will first creat a <strong class="Colour">botnet</strong>. This is done by sending <strong class="Colour">malware</strong> to many computers to try and get you to accidentally download it. Once you have downloaded the malware, the computer can then be used as a <strong class="Colour">bot</strong> by the perpetrator. Whilst the bot is not being used it is often called a <strong class="Colour">zombie</strong>. Once the perpetrator wants to carry out the attack, they 'wake up' all the zombies to be used as bots. Each bot will begin sending multiple requests to access a web server. They are all set to send requests to the same web server all at the same time. This floods the web server with too many requests and it begins to struggle to deal with each request. The wen server can only deal with a certain number of requests at a time and if it is sent too many requests it will begin to slow down and eventually crash. This will mean that users can no longer access the website. This causes a denial of service to any normal requests to access the web server. This type of attack is normally carried out on a on a web server, but it could be used to target other types of servers and network hardware.</p>
        <p>There are several reasons a perpetrator may carry out a DDoS attack. They may make a demand for money to the company to get them to pay to stop the attack from happening. They may want to punish the company from something that the perpetrator thinks they have done wrong, such as an unethical issue. This would be in an act of revenge or activism.</p>
        <p>The main security solution that a company can use to stop a DDoS attack occurring on their web server is to use a <strong class="Colour">proxy server</strong>. A proxy server can be used as a barrier to a web server by getting all the requests for the web server to pass through the proxy server fist. The poxy server can examine each request and forward it on to the web server to allow access. If the proxy server begins to recive many requests, it can begin to aloww to pass them through at a slower rate to avoid the web server being flooded with all the requests at the smae time. This may mean access to the website is slower, but still possible by users that want to legitimately access it. A proxy server can also use a feature called caching. This feature can help prevent a DDoS attack from being successful as once the proxy server has recived a request to access the website from a certant IP address it will stop any repeated requests for a short period of time from the same IP address, therefore, if a bot is sending multiple requests, not all of them will passed onto the web server as some will be stopped by the proxy server. This makes it more difficult for a perpetrator to flood the web server.</p>
        <p>As a user, you can try and prevent your computer ever being used as a bot in a DDoS attack by regularly scanning your computer with <strong class="Colour">anti-malware</strong> software. This is a type of software that scans all of the files in your computer to see if any of them are known to be malware. It dose this by compare=ing each file against a known listof malware to see if any of the files on your computer match. If it finds a file that matches, it will put it in a special area called a quarantine area. It will then inform you that it has found what it thinks is malware and will ask you if you want to delete the file. By scanning your computer with anti-malware software on a regular basis, you can help make sure that your computer is free from any malware that might be used to turn  it into a bot in a DDoS attack.</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>What happens?</th>
                <td>Malware is sent to lots of computers to turn them into bots to create a botnet. The perpetrator then uses the botnet to send to many requests to a web server, all at the same time.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>What is the aim?</th>
                <td>The aim is to cause the web server to crash. The perpetrator may be doing this to demand money for it to stop, or as an act of revenge or activism.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>What security solution can be used?</th>
                <td>The company can use a proxy server to act as a barrier that filters requests to the web server. You can scan your computer with anti-malware on a regular basis to try and prevent it being used as a bot.</td>

        <h3>Hacking</h3>
        <p><strong class="Colour">Hacking</strong> is the act of trying to gain unauthorised access to data. A perpetrator that dose this is known as a <strong class="Colour">hacker</strong>. They can do this by using a range of technical skills that allow them to break into a computer or a network. This can be done by going through methods such as a brute-force attack (This is sometimes known as cracking) or by exploiting vulnerabilities in a computer or a network, which are areas that the hacker can identify that lack the protection of security solutions.</p>
        <p>Hackers will gain access to a system for several reasons. This could be to steal your data to try and steal your identity, as an act of revenge, to corrupt your data or to leak confidential data about a company or project, or an act of activism.</p>
        <p>The main way that you can stop your computer being hacked is to have as many security soloutions in place as posible. One of the main security solutions that can be used is a <strong class="Colour">firewall</strong>. A firewall is a barrier that can be used between your data and the rest of a network. It can be software based or hardware baseed. Any data that is sent into and out of yur computer is examined by the firewall. Rules can be for this data by giving your firewall a set of criteria to examine the data against. The data that is sent through the firewall is compared to the criteria. The firewall can be set to accept the data and allow it to pass through the firewall, or reject the data and stop it from passing through the firewall, depending on whether it dose or dose not meet the criteria. This added security solution may help identify data that a hacker has sent that looks malicious and reject this data to stop the hacker getting into the computer or network. A firewall can also be used to close certain <strong class="ports">ports</strong> to a network. A hacker may look to find a vulnerability, such as an open port, to get into a network. A firewall can be set to close as many ports as it can that are not being used, to try and prevent a hacker exploiting an open port to gain access.</p>
        <p>One kind of vulnerability that hackers may try to exploit is out of data software. Sometimes, a software company may find that they have an issue with their software that could allow a hacker to gain unauthorised access. If you have downloaded this software, you have also created </p>
