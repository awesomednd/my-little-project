        <h1>Making Measurements</h1>
        <h2>Measuring Length and Volume</h2>
        <p>In physics we make measurements of many diffrent lengths. For this we would use a rule (ruler) for long distances and we would. We would put the object straight on the rule and then we would look at the marking and theat would show you the length of the object.</p>
        <h2>Measuring Volumes</h2>
        <p>To mesure volume of a regularly shaped object such as a rectangle we would mesure the length breadth(Height) width so we would times the breadth×length×width=V V=volume.</p>
        <h3>Measuring Volume by displacement</h3>
        <p>We use displacement to mesure the volume of an irregulary shaped object. First we would measure the volume of water in the mesureing cylinder then we must save that as B= volume before and A= volume after so we then minus B-A.</p>
