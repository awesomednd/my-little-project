        <pre>
            Verse 1:
            D              G
            I wake up in the morning, and I check my phone
            C              D
            I see the notification, and my heart sinks to the floor
            D              G
            Eskom's load shedding, and I can't believe it's true
            C              D
            Another day of darkness, and I don't know what to do

            Chorus:
            G              D
            I've got the load shedding blues, and I can't shake it off
            C              G
            I'm stuck in the dark, and I can't do a thing
            D              C
            I'm tired of the frustration, and the constant delays
            G              D
            I've got the load shedding blues, and I can't escape

            Verse 2:
            D              G
            I try to work from home, but the power keeps going out
            C              D
            I can't get anything done, and I start to pout
            D              G
            Eskom's load shedding, and it's driving me insane
            C              D
            I can't take it anymore, and I start to complain

            Chorus:
            G              D
            I've got the load shedding blues, and I can't shake it off
            C              G
            I'm stuck in the dark, and I can't do a thing
            D              C
            I'm tired of the frustration, and the constant delays
            G              D
            I've got the load shedding blues, and I can't escape

            Bridge:
            G              D
            I wish that Eskom, would just fix the problem
            C              G
            But it seems like it's here to stay
            D              C
            I'm fed up with the darkness, and the constant stress
            G              D
            I've got the load shedding blues, and I can't take it anymore
            
            Outro:
            G              D
            I've got the load shedding blues, and I can't shake it off
            C              G
            I'm stuck in the dark, and I can't do a thing
            D              C
