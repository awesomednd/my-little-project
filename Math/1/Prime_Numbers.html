        <h1>Prime Numbers</h1>
        <p>Prime numbers are numbers that can not be divided by an other number but itself and 1</p>
        <h1>Prime Factors</h1>
        <p>Prime factort are also prime number</p>
        <p>You can find them by making a factor tree</p>
        <img src="../Images/Factor_tree.png" alt="Factor tree">
        <p>you can use factor trees to find the LCM and HCF</p>
        <p>Lets say you want to find LCM and HCF of 48 and 108</p>
        <p>The prime factors of 48 and 108 are:</p>
        <p>48=2x2x2x2x3</p>
        <p>108=2x2x3x3x3</p>
        <p>to find the LCM you will multiple the numbers but only the one with the highest of thea number</p>
        <p>The LCM whould be</p>
        <p>2x2x2x2x3x3x3=432</p>
        <p>Then to find the HCF you will multiple numbers that both have but the amount of the least so</p>
        <P>The HCF of 48 and 108 is</P>
        <p>2x2x3=12</p>
