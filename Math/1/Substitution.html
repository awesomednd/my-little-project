        <h1>Substitution</h1>
        <p>Expressions have Different values depending on what numbers you substitute for the varibles. For example, Let's say casual waiters get paid $5 per hour. You can write an expression to represent everyone's wages like this 5H where H is the number of hours worked. If you work 1 hour, then you get paid 5x1=$5. So the expression 5H has the value $5 in this case. If you work 6 hours, you get paid 5x6=$30. The expression5H has a value of $30 in this case</p>
