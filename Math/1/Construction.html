        <h1>Construction</h1>
        <p>In geomerty, constructions are accurate geometrical drawings. You use mathematical instruments to construct geometrical drawings.</p>
        <h2 class="Y2">Using a ruler and a pair of compasses</h2>
        <p>Your ruler (Sometimes called a straight-edge or a rule) and a pair of compasses are probably your most useful construction tools. You use the ruler to draw straight lines and the pair of compasses to measure and mark lengths, draw circles and bisect angles and Lines</p>
        <p>Do remember how to use a pair of compasses to mark a given length.</p>
        <h1 class="Y2">Constructing triangles</h1>
        <p>You can draw a triangle if you know the leangth of three sides. <br> Read through the worked examples carefully to see how to construct a triangle given three sides.</p>
