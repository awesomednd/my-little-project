        <h2 class="Y2">Measuring and drawing angles</h2>
        <p>The size of an angle is the amount of turn from one arm of the angle to the other. Angle sizes are measured in degrees (°) from 0 to 360 using a protractor.</p>
        <img src="../Images/protractor.png" alt="Protracto">
        <p>When measured angles < 180° you can use a protractor to mesure the angle you would poit the one line at 0° and you would look at where the other line ends up and then that would be the angle you end up on in degrees</p>
        <p>When Measuring angles > 180° you can use a protractor by finding the 180° angle and the find the angle from the bottem of the 180° angle found.</p>
        <h2 class="Y2">Angle realationships</h2> 
        <p>Make sure you know the following angle facts:</p>
        <p class="y2">Complementary angles</p>
        <p>Angles in a right angle add up to 90°. <br> When the sum of two angles is 90° those two angles are complementary angles.</p>
        <img src="../Images/Complementary_Angles.png" alt="complementary angles" width="600" height="600">
        <p>a+b = 90°</p>
        <p class="Y2">Sublementry angles</p>
        <p>Angles on a straight line add up to 180°. <br> When the sum of two angles is 180° those two angles are supplementary angles.</p>
        <img src="../Images/Supplementary-Angles-1.png" alt="Supplementary angles">
        <p class="Y2">Angles round a point</p>
        <p>Angles at a point make a complete revolution. <br> The sum of angles at a point is 360°</p>
        <img src="../Images/angle-360.gif" alt="Angles around a point">
        <p class="Y2">Vertically opposite angles</p>
        <p>When two lines intersect, two pairs of <strong class="DB2">Vertically opposite</strong> angles are formed. <br> Vertically opposite angles are equal in size.</p>
        <img src="../Images/VOA.png" alt="Vertically opposite angles">
        <h2 class="Y2">Angles and parallel Lines</h2>
        <p>When two parallel lines are cut by a third line (the transversal) eight angles are formed. These angles form pairs which are related to each other in specific ways.</p>
        <p class="Y2">Corresponding angles ('F'-shape)</p>
        <p>When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal four pairs of <strong class="DB2">corresponding</strong> angles are formed. <br> Corresponding angles are equal to each other.</p>

        <p class="Y2">Alternate angles ('Z'-shape)</p>
        <p>When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal two pairs of <strong class="DB2">alternate</strong> angles are formed. <br> Alternate angles are equal to each other.</p>
        <img src="../Images/alt_angles.png" alt="alternate angles">
        <p class="Y2">Co-interior angles ('C'-shape)</p>
        <p>When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal two pairs of <strong class="DB2">co-interior</strong> angles are formed. <br> Co-interior angles are supplementary (together they add uo to 180°)</p>
