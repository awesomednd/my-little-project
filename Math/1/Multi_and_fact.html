        <h1>Multiples and Factors</h1>
        <p>You can think of a multiples of a number as the 'times table' for that number. for example, the multiples of 3 are 3 are 3x1=3 3x2=6 3x3=9 and so on.</p>
        <h2>Multiples</h2>
        <p>A multiple of a number is found when you multiply that number by a positive integer. The first multiple of any number is the number itself (the number multiplied by 1).</p>
        <h2>Factors</h2>
        <p>A factor is a number that divides exactly into another number with no remainder. For example, 2 is a factor of 16 because it goes into 16 exactly 8 times. 1 is a factor of every number. The largest factor of any number is the number itself.</p>
        <h2>LCM</h2>
        <p>The LCM of a group of numbers can be found by multiply them by 1 to infinty until you find the number that are the same</p>
        <h2>HCF</h2>
        <p>THe HCF of a group of numbers can be found by creating a factor list of each number and looking for the highest one that match.</p>
