        <h1>Using Letters to Represent Unknown Values</h1>
        <p>In primary school you used empty shapes to Represent unknown Numbers.</p>
        <p>In algebra, you use letter to represent unknown numbers. So you could write the number sentences above as: 2+𝑥=8 and a+b=10. Number sentences are called <strong class="DB2">equations</strong>. You can solve an equation by finding the values that make the equation true.</p>
        <p>When you worked with the are of rectangles and triangles in the past, you used algebra to make a general rule, or <strong class="DB2">formula</strong>, for working out the area, A:</p>
        <p>Area of a rectangle = length X breadth, so A = LB</p>
        <p>Area of a triangle ¹/₂ base x height, so A=¹/₂BH or A=BH/2</p>
        <p>Notice that when two letters are multiplied together, we write them next to each other e.g. LB, rather than LxB</p>
