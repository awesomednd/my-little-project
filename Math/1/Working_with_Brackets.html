        <h1>Working with Brackets</h1>
        <p>When an expression has brackets, you normally have to remove the brackets before you simplyfy the expression. Reomveing the brackets is called expanding the expression.</p>
        <p>To remove brackets you multiply each term by the number (and/or variables) outside the bracket. When you do this you need to pay attention to the positive or negative sings in front of the terms:</p>
        <p>洧논(y+z)=洧논y+洧논z</p>
        <p>洧논(y-z)=洧논y-洧논z</p>
        <h2>Expanding and collecting like terms</h2>
        <p>When you remove brackets and expand an expression you may end up with some like terms. When this happens, you collect the like terms together and add or subtract them to write the expression in its simplest terms. e.g.;</p>
        <p>6(洧논+3)=4  remove the brackets 6洧논+18+4 = 6洧논+22</p>
