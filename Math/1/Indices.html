        <h1>Indices</h1>
        <h2>Revisiting index notation</h2>
        <p>You already know how to write powers of two or three using indices:</p>
        <p>2x2=2²   and     yxy=y²</p>
        <p>2x2x2=2³     and     yxyxy=y³</p>
        <p>When you write a number using indices (Powers) you have written it in index notation. Any number can be used as an index including 0, negative integers and fractions. The index tells you how many times the <strong class="DB2">base</strong> has been multiplied by itself. So:</p>
        <p>3x3x3x3=3⁴       3 is the base, 4 is the index</p>
        <p>axaxaxaxa=a⁵       a is the base, 5 is the index</p>
        <p>SO if we would put axaxaxaxaxaxaxa=a⁸        a is the base, 7 is the index</p>
        <h2>Index notation and products of prime Factors</h2>
        <p>Index notation is very useful when you have to expess a number as a product of its prime factors because it allows you to write the factors in a short form.</p>
        <p>For example with factor trees or devsion method (For this example i will use devsion method because of the html limatations):</p>

        <h2>The laws of indices</h2>
        <p>the laws of indices are very important in algebra because they give you quick ways of simplyfying expressions. You will use these laws over again as you learn more and more algebra, so it is important that you understand them and that you can apply them in diffrent situations.</p>
        <h3>multiplying the same base with diffrent indices</h3>
        <p>Look at these two multiplication:</p>
        <p>3²x3⁴    𝑥³x𝑥⁴</p>
        <p>The first multiplication, 3 is the 'base' number and in the second, 𝑥 is the 'base' number.</p>
        <p>You already know you can simplify these by expanding them like this:</p>
        <p>3x3x3x3x3x3=3⁶        𝑥x𝑥x𝑥x𝑥x𝑥x𝑥x𝑥=𝑥⁷</p>
        <p>in other words:</p>
        <p>3²x3⁴=3²⁺⁴       𝑥³x 𝑥⁴=𝑥³⁺⁴</p>
        <h3>dividing the same base fractions with diffrent indcies</h3>
        <p>when deviding the same base with diffrent indcies you should put the first number on the top of the fraction and the second number on the bottem of the fraction and then cross out the same amount on the top as there is on the bottem</p>
        <h3>The power 0</h3>
        <p>when anything is to the power of 0 it is always going to be 1</p>
        <h3>Rasing to a power</h3>
        <p>When rasing a number in brackets that already ha an indices:</p>
        <p>(𝑥³)⁴ = 𝑥³ˣ⁴</p>
        <h3>negative indices</h3>
        <p>At the beginning of this unit you read that negative numbers can also be used as indices. But what dose it mean if an undex is negative?</p>
        <p>𝑥³÷𝑥⁵ = 𝑥⁻²</p>
        <p>So we cant display this as a negitive so we must put it in a fraction and it must be ether over a positive number or over 1: 1/𝑥²</p>
        <h2>Fractional indices</h2>
        <p>The laws of indices also apply when the index is a fraction. Look at these examples carefully to see what fractional indices mean in algebra:</p>
        <p>𝑥¹/² x 𝑥¹/²</p>
        <p>= 𝑥¹/²⁺¹/²</p>
        <p>= 𝑥¹</p>
        <p>= 𝑥</p>
        <p>y¹/³ x y¹/³ x y¹/³</p>
        <p>= y¹/³⁺¹/³⁺¹/³</p>
        <p>= y¹</p>
        <p>= y</p>
        <p>What number multiplied by itself and then by itself again will give y?</p>
        <p>∛y x ∛y x ∛y = y</p>
        <p>So y¹/³ = ∛y</p>
        <h2>Dealing with non-unit fractions</h2>
        <p>Sometimes you may have to work with indices that are non-unit fractions. For example 𝑥²/³ or y³/⁴. To find the rule for working with these, you have to think back to the law of indices for rasing a power to another power. Look at these examples carefully to see how this works:</p>
        <p>𝑥²/³ = (𝑥¹/²)²       ⅓x2 is ⅔</p>
        <p>y³/⁴ = (y¹/⁴)³       ¼x3 is ¾</p>
        <p>You already know that a unit-fraction gives a root. So we can rewrite these expressions using root sings like this:</p>
        <p>(𝑥¹/³)² = (∛𝑥)² and (y¹/⁴)³ = (∜y)³</p>
        <p>So,(𝑥²/³) = (∛𝑥)² and (y³/⁴) = (∜y)³</p>
