        <h1>Indices</h1>
        <h2>Revisiting index notation</h2>
        <p>You already know how to write powers of two or three using indices:</p>
        <p>2x2=2²   and     yxy=y²</p>
        <p>2x2x2=2³     and     yxyxy=y³</p>
        <p>When you write a number using indices (Powers) you have written it in index notation. Any number can be used as an index including 0, negative integers and fractions. The index tells you how many times the <strong class="DB2">base</strong> has been multiplied by itself. So:</p>
        <p>3x3x3x3=3⁴       3 is the base, 4 is the index</p>
        <p>axaxaxaxa=a⁵       a is the base, 5 is the index</p>
        <p>SO if we would put axaxaxaxaxaxaxa=a⁸        a is the base, 7 is the index</p>
        <h2>Index notation and products of prime Factors</h2>
        <p>Index notation is very useful when you have to expess a number as a product of its prime factors because it allows you to write the factors in a short form.</p>
        <p>For example with factor trees or devsion method (For this example i will use devsion method because of the html limatations):</p>
        <p>200</p>
