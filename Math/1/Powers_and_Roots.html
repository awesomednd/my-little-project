        <h1>Powers and Roots</h1>
        <h2>Powers</h2>
        <p>to find powers you have to multiply the number by its power</p>
        <p>e.g. 5^6</p>
        <p>5x5x5x5x5x5=15,625</p>
        <h2>Roots</h2>
        <p>to fine the root of a number you will have to find a a number that can be devided by a number three times to make a cube root</p>
        <p>The easyist way to find the root is use the prime factors to lets say you want to find the square root of 324 </p>
        <p>The prime factors are 2x2x3x3x3x3</p>
        <p>you will have to find a group of numbers that is exactly the same but the group can only be as big as the root you are you are looking for so for 324 it would be</p>
        <p><u>2x2</u> <u>3x3</u> <u>3x3</u></p>
        <p>So it would be 2x3x3=18</p>
        <P>So the square root of 324 is 18</P>
        <h2>Square numbers and square roots</h2>
        <p>A <strong>Square number</strong> is a number that is multiplyed by its self so 5 x 5 = 25 so 25 is a square number.</p>
        <p>A <strong>Square root</strong> is a the root of a number so 25 square root would be 5 is a square root.</p>
        <h2>Powers</h2>
        <p>A <strong>Power</strong> is a number multipley by itself a defined by a number. To find the answer we must multiply it by the power so 5 to the power of 5 = 5x5x5x5x5=3125</p>
        <H3>Find powers</H3>
        <p>to find powers we must find what it is the power to so lets say that we have 532⁵²</p>
        <p>So we must now see how many times we must times it by itself by so 52 times which would be</p>
        <p>532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532 x 532</p>
        <p>So that would =5 589 910 820 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 or in scientific notation 5.58991082x10¹⁴¹</p>
        <p>Lets try something more simple 24⁷</p>
        <p>24 x 24 x 24 x 24 x 24 x 24 x 24</p>
        <P>which would = 4586471424</P>
