        <h1>Equivalent fractions</h1>
        <p>A <strong class="DB2">fraction</strong> is a part of a hole number.</p>
        <p>Common fractions (also called <strong class="DB2">vulgar fractions</strong> are writen in the form Â½. The number on the top, 1, can be any number and is called the <strong class="DB2">numerator</strong>. The number on the bottom, 2, can be any number except 0 and is called the <strong class="DB2">denominator</strong>. The numerator and the denomerator are seperated by a horisontal line.</p>
        <p>If you multiply or divide both the numerator and denominator by the same number, the new fraction still represents the same amount of the whole as the orginal fraction. The new fraction is known as an <strong class="DB2">Equivalent fractions</strong>.</p>
        <p>When you make the fraction simplfyed this is known as Equivalent fractions.</p>
