        <p>You have already seen that you can rewrite algebra algebra with the use of expressions that contain brackets by expanding them. The procces is called expansion. This work will now be extended to consider what happens when negative numbers appear before the brackets.</p>
        <p>The key isnto remember that a '+' or a '−' is attached to the number immediately following it and should be included when you use multiply out brackets.</p>
        <p>E.G.</p>
        <p>Lets say you have -4(𝑥 + 7) first you will need to know that if there are 2 negitives that make a positive. <br> -4(𝑥 + 7) expand <br> -4 × 𝑥 + -4 × 7 then simplfy <br> -4𝑥 + -28 Note that you can only add together like terms</p>
        <p>E.G. 2 <br> lets say that you know have <br> 4(𝑦 − 9) −5(5𝑦 + 7) expand note that a - and + make minus <br> 4 × 𝑦 + 4 × (−9) − 5 × 5𝑦 + −5 × 7 simplfy <br> 4𝑦 − 36 − 25𝑦 − 35 add like terms <br> −25𝑦 − 71</p>
