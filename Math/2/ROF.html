        <h1>Rearrangement of a formula</h1>
        <p>We can use Rearrangement of a formula to change the subject of formula. So first we would get the sum. <br> Make 𝑏 the subject <br> 𝑎𝑏 = 𝑐 first we must devide both sides by 𝑎 <br> 𝑏 = 𝑎÷𝑐 so that is how to change subject of formula with times now divide. <br> 𝑎÷𝑏 = 𝑐 Times by 𝑎 <br> 𝑏 = 𝑐𝑎 <br> Now plus <br> 𝑎+𝑏 = 𝑐 now first we must minus a both sides <br> 𝑏 = 𝑐−𝑎 <br> Now minus <br> 𝑎−𝑏 = 𝑐 now we must add 𝑎 both side <br> 𝑏 = 𝑐+𝑎 <br> Now with plus and times <br>𝑎+𝑏𝑐 = 𝑑 first we must minus a from both sides <br> 𝑏𝑐 = 𝑑−𝑎 divide it by 𝑐 <br> 𝑏 = (𝑑−𝑎)÷𝑐 <br> Now we will do minus and divide <br> (𝑎−𝑏)÷𝑐 = 𝑑 first times all by 𝑐 <br> (𝑎𝑐−𝑏𝑐)÷𝑐 = 𝑑 you must now simplfy<br> 𝑎-𝑏 = 𝑑 now we must minus 𝑎 to both sides <br> −𝑏 = 𝑑−𝑎 now we must times by −1 to make 𝑏 positive <br> 𝑏 = 𝑎−𝑑</p>
