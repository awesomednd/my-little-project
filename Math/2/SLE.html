        <h1>Solving linear equations</h1>
        <p>Linear equations are used to solve an unknown number that is represented by a letter. E.G.</p>
        <p>lets say you have 3𝑥 + 1 = 13 first we need to get rid of 1 so we will move it to the other side but the sing will change <br> 3𝑥 = 13 − 1 next we must simplfy <br> 3𝑥 = 12 next we must devide both sides by 3 <br> 3𝑥 ÷ 3 = 12 ÷ 3 now simplefy <br> 𝑥 = 4</p>
        <p>Lets say now we have 2 numbers with 𝑥 E.G.</p>
        <p>5𝑥 - 2 = 3𝑥 + 6 first we must move the to to other side <br> 5𝑥 = 3𝑥 + 6 + 2 next move 3𝑥 to other side <br> 5𝑥 - 3𝑥 = 6 + 2 next we must simplfy <br> 2𝑥 = 8 next we must devide it all by 2 <br> 2𝑥 ÷ 2 = 8 ÷ 2 simplfy <br> 𝑥 = 4</p>
