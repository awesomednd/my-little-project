        <h1>Operations on fractions</h1>
        <h2>Multiplying fractions</h2>
        <p>When Multiplying two or more fractions you can simply multiply the numerator and then multiply the denominator sometimes you need to simplefy the fractions.</p>
        <h2>Adding and subtracting fractions</h2>
        <p>you can only add or subtract fractions only if the denomerator is the same. If they have diffrent denominators we have to make them the same, first you should find th LCM(Lowest common multiple) so once you found the LCM you must then divide the the lcm by both the denominators then you must multiply the numerator the same amount as the denominator.</p>
        <h2>Dividing fractions</h2>
        <p>When dividing fractions we cant just devide them first we must flip the denomerator and the numerator of the second fraction they we treat it as a multiplecation fraction and then follow the same rules as Multiplying fractions.</p>
        <h2>Fractions with decimals</h2>
        <p>for fractions with decimal we must times it by 10 - 1000000000000000 until we have it as a hole number.</p>
