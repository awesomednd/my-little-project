        <h1>Percentages</h1>
        <p>A <strong class="DB2">percentage</strong> is a fraction with the denominator of 100. The symbol used for Percentages is %.</p>
        <p>To find fractions we must devide the total by 100 and then times this by the maximum amount total.</p>
        <p>To convert a fraction to a decimal we must devide it by 100. to convert a decimal to a fraction we must times it by 100 to get the percentage.</p>
        <h3>Finding one number as a percentage of another</h3>
        <p>To find this you must put it as a fraction of the other number and times that by 100 and that would be the percentage</p>
        <h3>Percentage increases and decreases</h3>
        <p>When calculating the percentage increase we must subtract the new amount by the orginal amount then we must devide the increase by the orginal prie and then we would get our percentage.</p>
        <h3>Increasing and decreasing by a given percentage</h3>
        <p>When we increase a number by a percentage so to calculate a percentage increase we should have 100+ the percentage to increase over 100 x the maximum amount total.</p>
        <p>To decrease the percentage we must 100- percentage decrease over 100 x maximum amount total.</p>
        <h3>Reverse percentage</h3>
        <p>So lest say your barber had decreased there price y 10% and the new price is R70. To find this we must 100-90 over 100 X 70 but this would creat the decrease so we must flip the fraction over and then we would have 100/90 x 70 which would = R77.58</p>
